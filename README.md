### Goal: Create a website for "Cool Dads"

Now that I am a father, I try very hard to impress my two daughters. While they don't understand Javascript, they do have a basic understanding of the internet and how it has something to do with iPads. The main purpose of this website is to practice and showcase my HTML, CSS and Javascript skills that I have been working on during my time as a student at Code Louisville. The secondary purpose of the site is to impress my daughters by showing them that I am, and always will be, a "Cool Dad!"   

## Current Features 
    1. Dad Jokes: Uses fetch method to retrieve a random dad joke and display it.
    2. Dad Memes: Create array of memes, iterate over it, and display the meme in a slideshow. 
    3. Dad Tips: Creates function that accepts a tip value, calculates and returns new tip values. 
    4. Touch Base: Contact form with validation.
    4. Responsive website design using flexbox and media queries.

## Roadmap
    1. Clean up some of the repetation in the CSS. 
    2. A Cool Dad needs a beer. Create random beer or brewery generator.
    3. A Cool Dad needs to watch his sodium. Grab a low sodium Trader Joes items via CSV.
